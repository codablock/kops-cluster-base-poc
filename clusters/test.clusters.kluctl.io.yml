# This file is usually meant to be provided by the user of kluctl (usually it's not even part of the deployment repo
# itself and lives in a dedicated clusters repo so that it can be shared between deployments), but for kops integration
# it might sense to auto-generate it and store it inside a configmap, so that kluctl can then grab it from there.
# The file could also just be created temporarely by some kops component on the cluster so that kluctl can be invoked
# automatically when needed.
